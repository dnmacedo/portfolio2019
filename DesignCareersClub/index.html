    <p><strong><a href="https://arts.ucdavis.edu/general-information/design-careers-club-uc-davis">Design Careers Club</a></strong>, established in 2016 by Tiffany Trieu, the club's misson is "to empower students to take bold risks not only in their designs, but in their career aspirations."
    The club is entirely volunteer based consisting of passionate students wanting to bring resources and opportunities for the school's design community. The goal of the club is to connect current students with alumni, design professionals, and resources in order to prepare them to step out confidently into their industry. I had the honor to succeed the position of Co-director along with my
    fellow Co-Director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brye-elyacy-76832496">Boriar (Brye) Elyacy</a> after our previous directors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serinachung?trk=people-guest_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click" style="text-decoration:underline;">
    Serina Chung</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffanytrieu">Tiffany Trieu</a> (Founder).
    <br><br>Beside my Co-Director I lead a crew of 8 amazing leads who each had their own team and role in the club. As a club we threw on workshops for design students that would
    feature faculty to guest lecture, as well as larger annual events such as Internship Night, Alumni Networking Day and (the largest one) The Design Career Fair. None of these
    events would have done as well as they did without the unique contributions of every lead and member. Below are the teams and highlights of our events.</p>

    <p><a href="https://arts.ucdavis.edu/event/design-careers-clubs-annual-alumni-networking-day"><strong>Alumni Networking Day</strong></a>
    invites UC Davis Design Alumni to share their stories, tips and connect with current design students seeking mentors in their career.
    The event of 2017 was a tremendous success, capping over 100 attendees – including faculty, students and alumni.
    The event was not only an opportunity for students to make connections, but a grand reunion for many faculty members and alumni, as old friends reconnected.
    <br><br>
    The event started with keynote presentations from 3 different alumni about their story or recent work. It was then followed by a panel discussion
    led by myself and my clubmate Kayana Leung, where we asked open ended questions to our panel of 9 alumni, years graduated ranging from 1 to 20!
    The remainder of the event was an hour of eating, networking and visiting local vendor's tables selling art or promoting organizations. Overall it was a
    a way for desingers of all years of experience to come together and strengthen a growing community.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://arts.ucdavis.edu/event/3rd-annual-design-career-fair"><strong>Design Career Fair</strong></a>
    was started at UC Davis by Tiffany Trieu. The purpose of the fair is to gather companies all over California seeking designers
    and open doors to oppurtunities for design students at UC Davis. Each year there have been dozens of companies that participate
    and usually have 300 in attendance. We also had special smaller events happening simultaneously such as keynote presentations, or
    group discussions in other rooms.
    <br><br>Design Career Fair was a way to bring what standard quarterly Career Fairs at UC Davis were lacking, which were opportunities
    in the creative field. We owe it all to our founder Tiffany, and today the Club is still dedicated to bring this incredible event to the design community
    at UC Davis.</p>
